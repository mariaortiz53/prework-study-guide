# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
I made this website to help students during the coding bootcamp. The page has important factors about each coding language they will be studying and learning. This helps students by refreshing their memories and making them feel less overwhelmed with all the information being thrown at them at once. I learned a little bit of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript while making this as well as how to use Github and setting it up in my terminal. I also learned how to use VS Code.

## Usage

This website is intended to be used as a study guide. There are currently 4 topics on it (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git). It is organized and designed to isolate each language to make it easier on the user to find what they are looking for. If you run it in Google Chrome and right click there will be an "inspect" option pop up, choose it and it will take you to DevTools. Once you're there, choose console and you should be able to see JavaScript running.
